# Execution configurations
# NOTE: Executions should be defined in your main pipeline config file (pipeline.yaml)
# NOT in this pipeline job file. This is just an example of how to structure executions.
#
# Example execution in pipeline.yaml:
# executions:
#   - name: "Development Build"
#     key: "dev"
#     pipeline: "my-pipeline.yaml"
#     variables:
#       DOCKER_TAG: "dev-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
#
#   - name: "Production Deploy"
#     key: "prod"
#     pipeline: "my-pipeline.yaml"
#     hosts: ["prod-server-01", "prod-server-02"]
#     variables:
#       DOCKER_TAG: "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
