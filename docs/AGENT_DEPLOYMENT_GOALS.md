# Pipeline Agent Deployment Goals

**Status:** âœ… PHASES 1-3 COMPLETED | ðŸ”„ PHASE 4 IN PROGRESS  
**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Completion:** ~90% (Core functionality operational)

## Overview
This document outlines the goals and implementation strategy for agent-based file transfer in the **pipeline system only**. All development and implementation will be contained within the pipeline working directory to maintain clean separation from the main make-sync project.

**ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY ACHIEVEMENT:** Agent-based file transfer with include/exclude patterns, delete policies, and cross-platform support is now fully operational within the pipeline workspace.

## Key Achievements âœ…

### Core Functionality Implemented
- **Agent Management System**: Complete lifecycle (build â†’ deploy â†’ execute)
- **File Synchronization**: Hash-based incremental transfers with pattern filtering
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Linux/Windows deployment with OS-specific binaries
- **Module Independence**: pipeline-agent operates as separate Go module
- **Local Config System**: Unique agent naming to prevent conflicts

### Technical Implementation Highlights
- **Build Process**: Cross-platform compilation with automatic OS detection
- **SSH Operations**: Secure remote deployment and streaming command execution
- **Config Management**: JSON-based remote configuration with working directory setup
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery with detailed logging
- **Performance**: Concurrent file transfers with bounded parallelism

## Workspace Separation
- **Pipeline Workspace**: `/pipeline/` - Dedicated workspace for all pipeline-related development
- **Main Project**: `/` (root) - make-sync core functionality only
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Pipeline development stays isolated from main project

## Current Status
- âœ… Pipeline execution framework is working (in pipeline workspace)
- âœ… SSH connection and authentication is configured (pipeline-specific)
- âœ… Basic file transfer steps execute successfully (pipeline context)
- âœ… Agent build process working with cross-platform support (Linux/Windows)
- âœ… Go module isolation resolved - sync-agent operates as independent module
- âœ… Local config system implemented for unique agent binary naming
- âœ… Agent management methods fully implemented (BuildAgentForTarget, DeployAgent, etc.)
- âœ… File synchronization with hash-based comparison operational
- âœ… Include/exclude pattern filtering implemented
- âœ… Delete policies (force) implemented
- âœ… All modules compile successfully and tests pass

## Goals

### Primary Goal: Agent-Based File Transfer (Pipeline-Only) âœ… COMPLETED
Implement advanced file transfer capabilities with include/exclude patterns and delete policies using a deployed agent, **entirely within pipeline workspace**.

#### Features Implemented âœ…:
1. **Include/Exclude Filtering**: âœ… Support glob patterns for selective file transfer
2. **Delete Policies**:
   - `force`: âœ… Permanently delete extra files
   - `soft`: ðŸ”„ Move deleted files to trash (Phase 4)
3. **Cross-Platform**: âœ… Support Linux/Windows targets
4. **Real-time Sync**: âœ… Efficient incremental transfers based on file hashing

### Secondary Goals (Pipeline-Focused) âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETED
1. **Pipeline Modularity**: âœ… Clean separation between pipeline execution and agent deployment
2. **Error Handling**: âœ… Robust error handling and recovery within pipeline context
3. **Performance**: âœ… Optimized transfer speeds and resource usage
4. **Security**: âœ… Secure agent deployment and execution

## Technical Implementation (Pipeline Workspace Only)

### Agent Architecture (Within Pipeline) âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `./sub_app/agent/` (relative to pipeline workspace)
- **Purpose**: Remote file indexing and transfer operations
- **Communication**: SSH-based command execution and file operations
- **Module**: Separate Go module within pipeline workspace
- **Independence**: No dependencies on pipeline internal packages

### Pipeline Integration (Internal Only) âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Build Process**: âœ… Compile agent for target OS during pipeline execution
- **Deployment**: âœ… Upload and configure agent on remote host
- **Execution**: âœ… Run agent commands for indexing and transfer operations
- **Context**: âœ… All operations within pipeline working directory

### Resolved Challenges âœ…
1. **Go Module Isolation**: âœ… Resolved - sync-agent operates as independent module
2. **Path Resolution**: âœ… Resolved - correct source directory identification implemented
3. **Binary Management**: âœ… Resolved - efficient handling of cross-platform builds
4. **Import Conflicts**: âœ… Resolved - clean separation between pipeline and sync-agent modules
5. **Compilation Issues**: âœ… Resolved - all modules compile successfully

### Current Architecture Status
- **Pipeline Module**: Full agent management with local config integration
- **Sync-Agent Module**: Independent Go module ready for separate development
- **Local Config System**: Unique binary naming (`sync-agent` vs `sync-agent.exe`)
- **File Sync Engine**: Hash-based comparison with pattern filtering
- **SSH Operations**: Secure remote deployment and command execution

## Implementation Strategy (Pipeline Workspace Only)

### Phase 1: Fix Agent Build (Pipeline Context) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Resolve Go module isolation issues within pipeline workspace
- [x] Correct source directory paths relative to pipeline root
- [x] Implement fallback to pre-built binaries in pipeline environment
- [x] Create independent sync-agent module with local types

### Phase 2: Core Transfer Logic (Pipeline-Only) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement include/exclude pattern matching
- [x] Add file hashing and comparison (xxHash)
- [x] Support delete policy operations (force delete)
- [x] Cross-platform agent deployment (Linux/Windows)

### Phase 3: Agent Management Refactoring âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement BuildAgentForTarget() with OS-specific naming
- [x] Implement DeployAgent() with SSH upload
- [x] Implement RemoteRunAgentIndexing() with streaming
- [x] Implement uploadConfigToRemote() with JSON config
- [x] End-to-end pipeline testing within dedicated workspace
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [x] Performance benchmarking in isolated environment

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Pipeline Integration) ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Security hardening and audit trails
- [ ] Real-time sync with file watching capabilities
- [ ] Soft delete policy (trash) implementation

## Development Guidelines
- **Working Directory**: Always work from `/pipeline/` directory
- **No Main Project Changes**: Do not modify files outside pipeline workspace
- **Clean Separation**: Keep pipeline and main project completely isolated
- **Module Boundaries**: Respect Go module boundaries within pipeline

## Success Criteria
- [x] Pipeline can execute agent-based file transfers successfully within its workspace
- [x] Include/exclude patterns work correctly in pipeline context
- [x] Delete policies function as expected (force delete implemented)
- [x] Cross-platform deployment works from pipeline (Linux/Windows)
- [x] Performance is acceptable for typical use cases (hash-based incremental sync)
- [x] No contamination of main make-sync project (clean module separation)
- [x] Agent build and deployment operational
- [x] Module independence achieved (sync-agent as separate project)
- [x] Local config system functional (unique binary naming)
- [x] All compilation and testing passes

### Remaining Goals (Phase 4)
- [ ] Soft delete policy implementation (move to trash)
- [ ] Real-time file watching capabilities
- [ ] Enhanced error recovery and monitoring
- [ ] Security hardening and audit trails
